This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#setwd("C:/Users/pjc/Documents/Reproducible")
unzip("activity.zip") 
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=T, sep=",",na.strings="NA")
head(activity)
```

Classify the data to be used for the analysis and remove NA values from results

```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
clean_activity <- subset(activity, !is.na(activity$steps))
```
 What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Produce histogram to display the distribution of these figures.
```{r}
d_steps_count <- tapply(clean_activity$steps, clean_activity$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)

```
remove NA from count

```{r echo=FALSE}
d_steps_count <- d_steps_count[!is.na(d_steps_count)]
## Fig. 1 
hist(x=d_steps_count,breaks=20,xlab="Daily total steps",ylab="Frequency",col="red",
     main="The distribution of daily total (missing data ignored)")

## Calculate the mean and median total of daily steps
mean(d_steps_count)
## [1] 10766
median(d_steps_count)
## [1] 10765
#Mean is 10766 steps 
#Median is 10765 steps.
```
What is the average daily activity pattern?
Create the time series of daily activity pattern

```{r echo=FALSE}
avg_interval <- tapply(clean_activity$steps, clean_activity$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
activity_int <- data.frame(interval=as.integer(names(avg_interval)), avg=avg_interval)
with(activity_int,plot(interval,avg,type="l",
          xlab="5-minute intervals",
          ylab="average steps in the interval across all days"))

max_steps_interval <- max(activity_int$avg)
activity_int[activity_int$avg == max_steps_interval, ]
##     interval   avg
## 835      835 206.2
```
Imputing missing values
Number of NA records
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
## [1] 2304
## 2304 observations with NA values
```

Imputation: create a new dataset where NA values is replaced with the mean value
```{r}
activity_imputed <- activity
  x_na <- is.na(activity_imputed$steps)
interval_avg <- tapply(clean_activity$steps, clean_activity$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
activity_imputed$steps[x_na] <- interval_avg[as.character(activity_imputed$interval[x_na])]
```
Second representation of the data based on imputation of the mean.
```{r echo=FALSE}
d_steps_count2 <- tapply(activity_imputed$steps, activity_imputed$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
hist(x=d_steps_count2,
     col="red",
     breaks=20,
     xlab="daily steps",
     ylab="frequency",
     main="The distribution of daily total (with missing data imputed)")
```

```{r}
## new mean result
mean(d_steps_count2)
## [1] 10766
median(d_steps_count2)
## [1] 10766
```
After imputed data has been applied we got a new mean of 10766 and a new median of 10766.
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Get new factor variable "wk" in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
## helper function to decide if a day is a week day or not
is_weekday <- function(d) {
wd <- weekdays(d)
ifelse (wd == "Saturday" | wd == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
}
wks<- sapply(activity_imputed$date, is_weekday)
activity_imputed$wk <- as.factor(wks)
head(activity_imputed)
```

Five-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all ## weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
```{r echo=FALSE}
activity_wk <- aggregate(steps ~ wk+interval, data=activity_imputed, FUN=mean)

library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | factor(wk),
layout = c(1, 2),
xlab="Interval",
ylab="Number of steps",
type="l",
lty=1,
data=activity_wk)

## In conclusion we see from the plot that weekday activities started earlier than weekend activities.
## We also observed that week-end activities are higher than weekday activities.
